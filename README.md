# Ultra-Marathon-UM-Race-Analysis
This project involves analyzing Ultra-Marathon records for 50km and 50mi races in the USA during 2020. It starts by loading the dataset and verifying its structure, including the number of rows and data types. The data is filtered to focus specifically on the specified events, ensuring that only races held in the USA are included and removing irrelevant columns.

A new column for athlete age is added based on the year of birth, and missing values are handled while checking for duplicates. The analysis addresses specific questions about individual events and athletes, using histograms to visualize race lengths and allowing differentiation by gender.

Athlete performance is assessed through average speeds, with comparisons made between male and female runners. The project also explores which age groups performed well or poorly in the 50mi race, analyzing performance trends based on participation numbers.

Finally, the project involves analyzing race performance by season. The month of each race is extracted, and events are categorized into spring, summer, fall, or winter, enabling the calculation of average speeds across different seasons. This analysis provides insights into athlete performance across various events and demographics in the 2020 Ultra-Marathon races.
